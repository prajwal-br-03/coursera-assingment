            <div id=he1>Chicken</div>
            <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies
                of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
                 cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called 
                 a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female 
                 bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
               Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
                were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).
                [1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
                 their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

            <div class=he2>Beef</div>
            <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle.
                In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. 
                Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the
                quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely 
                consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the 
                United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.
                Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak,
                which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings 
                are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers</p>

            <div id=he3>Sushi</div>
            <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it
            can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often
            prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
            imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often 
            served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish
            or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
            is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine
            that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.</p>
